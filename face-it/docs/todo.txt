Project wide:
 - Remove the current documentation, as it is outdated in many places, as well as the code is subject to frequent big changes.
 - Currently there are lots of memory leaks, as most of the dynamic memory is not freed.
 - Code clean. There is some redundant code, classes whith almost identical function and implementation. A lot can be done with the names of classes, variables, etc.
 - Optimization. The process is way too slow for the current CPU capabilities. Ideally real time analyzies of a video stream would be a goal.

Neural Network:
 - Create a base abstract Network class, from which specific architectures (Kohonen map, FeedForward Network, Hopfield net, etc) woudl derive. This would ensure a standard way of interacting with the different types of networks.
 - Provide a way to easily make the computations inside the net multithreadable.

GUI:
 - Webcam support featuring live stream, from which frames would be captured and then analyzed. Currently WIP.
 - Main Windows interface improvement. It's asymetrical and crappy right now.
 - Implement a way to easily analyze inter-neuron connections and modify specific weights (is this of any use?)
 - Finish the XML Importer. Export works well now. Currently WIP.
 - Fix the face searching algorithm. Multithreading would be a piece of cake to implement (simultaneous searching with several networks).
 - Some kind of autodetection of the size of training images (Mark with different colors the entries with different sizes in Network Editor view?)
